## How it works

See the announcement of Interaction Testing with Storybook in detail in [this blog post](https://storybook.js.org/blog/interaction-testing-with-storybook/) or watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex52FHKyc7E&ab_channel=Storybook) to see it in action.

The Storybook test runner uses Jest as a runner, and Playwright as a testing framework. Each one of your `.stories` files is transformed into a spec file, and each story becomes a test, which is run in a headless browser.

The test runner is simple in design – it just visits each story from a running Storybook instance and makes sure the component is not failing:

- For stories without a `play` function, it verifies whether the story rendered without any errors. This is essentially a smoke test.
- For those with a `play` function, it also checks for errors in the `play` function and that all assertions passed. This is essentially an [interaction test](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/interaction-testing#write-an-interaction-test).

If there are any failures, the test runner will provide an output with the error, alongside with a link to the failing story, so you can see the error yourself and debug it directly in the browser:

## Storybook compatibility

Use the following table to use the correct version of this package, based on the version of Storybook you're using:

| Test runner version | Storybook version |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| ^0.10.0             | ^7.0.0            |
| ~0.9.4              | ^6.4.0            |

## Getting started

1. Install the test runner:

```jsx
yarn add @storybook/test-runner -D
```

2. Add a `test-storybook` script to your package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test-storybook": "test-storybook"
  }
}
```

3. Optionally, follow [the documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/interaction-testing#set-up-the-interactions-addon) for writing interaction tests and using [addon-interactions](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-interactions/) to visualize the interactions with an interactive debugger in Storybook.

4. Run Storybook (the test runner runs against a running Storybook instance):

```jsx
yarn storybook
```

5. Run the test runner:

```jsx
yarn test-storybook
```

> **Note**
> The runner assumes that your Storybook is running on port `6006`. If you're running Storybook in another port, either use --url or set the TARGET_URL before running your command like:
>
> ```jsx
> yarn test-storybook --url http://127.0.0.1:9009
> or
> TARGET_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9009 yarn test-storybook
> ```

## Ejecting configuration

The test runner is based on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and will accept most of the [CLI options](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli) that Jest does, like `--watch`, `--watchAll`, `--maxWorkers`, etc. It works out of the box, but if you want better control over its configuration, you can eject its configuration by running `test-storybook --eject` to create a local `test-runner-jest.config.js` file in the root folder of your project. This file will be used by the test runner.

> **Note**
> The `test-runner-jest.config.js` file can be placed inside of your Storybook config dir as well. If you pass the `--config-dir` option, the test-runner will look for the config file there as well.

The configuration file will accept options for two runners:

#### Jest-playwright options

The test runner uses [jest-playwright](https://github.com/playwright-community/jest-playwright) and you can pass [testEnvironmentOptions](https://github.com/playwright-community/jest-playwright#configuration) to further configure it.

#### Jest options

The Storybook test runner comes with Jest installed as an internal dependency. You can pass Jest options based on the version of Jest that comes with the test runner.

| Test runner version | Jest version       |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| ^0.6.2              | ^26.6.3 or ^27.0.0 |
| ^0.7.0              | ^28.0.0            |

> If you're already using a compatible version of Jest, the test runner will use it, instead of installing a duplicate version in your node_modules folder.

## Test reporters

The test runner uses default Jest reporters, but you can add additional reporters by ejecting the configuration as explained above and overriding (or merging with) the `reporters` property.

Additionally, if you pass `--junit` to `test-storybook`, the test runner will add `jest-junit` to the reporters list and generate a test report in a JUnit XML format. You can further configure the behavior of `jest-junit` by either setting specific `JEST_JUNIT_*` environment variables or by defining a `jest-junit` field in your package.json with the options you want, which will be respected when generating the report. You can look at all available options here: https://github.com/jest-community/jest-junit#configuration

## Running against a deployed Storybook

By default, the test runner assumes that you're running it against a locally served Storybook on port 6006.
If you want to define a target url so it runs against deployed Storybooks, you can do so by passing the `TARGET_URL` environment variable:

```bash
TARGET_URL=https://the-storybook-url-here.com yarn test-storybook
```

Or by using the `--url` flag:

```bash
yarn test-storybook --url https://the-storybook-url-here.com
```

### Index.json mode

By default, the test runner transforms your story files into tests. It also supports a secondary "index.json mode" which runs directly against your Storybook's index data, which dependending on your Storybook version is located in a `stories.json` or `index.json`, a static index of all the stories.

This is particularly useful for running against a deployed storybook because `index.json` is guaranteed to be in sync with the Storybook you are testing. In the default, story file-based mode, your local story files may be out of sync – or you might not even have access to the source code.

Furthermore, it is not possible to run the test-runner directly against `.mdx` stories or custom CSF dialects like when writing Svelte native stories with [`addon-svelte-csf`](https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-svelte-csf). In these cases `index.json` mode must be used.

<!-- TODO: switch details to 6.4 once Storybook 7.0 becomes default -->

<details>
<summary>If you're using Storybook 7.0</summary>

To run in `index.json` mode, first make sure your Storybook has a v4 `index.json` file. You can find it when navigating to:

```
https://your-storybook-url-here.com/index.json
```

It should be a JSON file and the first key should be `"v": 4` followed by a key called `"entries"` containing a map of story IDs to JSON objects.

In Storybok 7.0, `index.json` is enabled by default, unless you are using the `storiesOf()` syntax, in which case it is not supported.

</details>

On Storybook 6.4 and 6.5, to run in `index.json` mode, first make sure your Storybook has a file called `stories.json` that has `"v": 3`, available at:

```
https://your-storybook-url-here.com/stories.json
```

If your Storybook does not have a `stories.json` file, you can generate one, provided:

- You are running Storybook 6.4 or above
- You are not using `storiesOf` stories

To enable `stories.json` in your Storybook, set the `buildStoriesJson` feature flag in `.storybook/main.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  features: { buildStoriesJson: true },
};
```

Once you have a valid `stories.json` file, your Storybook will be compatible with the "index.json mode".

By default, the test runner will detect whether your Storybook URL is local or remote, and if it is remote, it will run in "index.json mode" automatically. To disable it, you can pass the `--no-index-json` flag:

```bash
yarn test-storybook --no-index-json
```

If you are running tests against a local Storybook but for some reason want to run in "index.json mode", you can pass the `--index-json` flag:

```bash
yarn test-storybook --index-json
```

> **Note**
> index.json mode is not compatible with watch mode.

## Running in CI

If you want to add the test-runner to CI, there are a couple of ways to do so:

### 1. Running against deployed Storybooks on Github Actions deployment

On Github actions, once services like Vercel, Netlify and others do deployment runs, they follow a pattern of emitting a `deployment_status` event containing the newly generated URL under `deployment_status.target_url`. You can use that URL and set it as `TARGET_URL` for the test-runner.

Here's an example of an action to run tests based on that:

```yml
name: Storybook Tests
on: deployment_status
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.deployment_status.state == 'success'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn
      - name: Run Storybook tests
        run: yarn test-storybook
        env:
          TARGET_URL: '${{ github.event.deployment_status.target_url }}'
```

> **Note**
> If you're running the test-runner against a `TARGET_URL` of a remotely deployed Storybook (e.g. Chromatic), make sure that the URL loads a publicly available Storybook. Does it load correctly when opened in incognito mode on your browser? If your deployed Storybook is private and has authentication layers, the test-runner will hit them and thus not be able to access your stories. If that is the case, use the next option instead.

### 2. Running against locally built Storybooks in CI

In order to build and run tests against your Storybook in CI, you might need to use a combination of commands involving the [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently), [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) and [wait-on](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wait-on) libraries. Here's a recipe that does the following: Storybook is built and served locally, and once it is ready, the test runner will run against it.

```json
{
  "test-storybook:ci": "concurrently -k -s first -n \"SB,TEST\" -c \"magenta,blue\" \"yarn build-storybook --quiet && npx http-server storybook-static --port 6006 --silent\" \"wait-on tcp:6006 && yarn test-storybook\""
}
```

And then you can essentially run `test-storybook:ci` in your CI:

```yml
name: Storybook Tests
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn
      - name: Run Storybook tests
        run: yarn test-storybook:ci
```

> **Note**
> Building Storybook locally makes it simple to test Storybooks that could be available remotely, but are under authentication layers. If you also deploy your Storybooks somewhere (e.g. Chromatic, Vercel, etc.), the Storybook URL can still be useful with the test-runner. You can pass it to the `REFERENCE_URL` environment variable when running the test-storybook command, and if a story fails, the test-runner will provide a helpful message with the link to the story in your published Storybook instead.

## Setting up code coverage

The test runner supports code coverage with the `--coverage` flag or `STORYBOOK_COLLECT_COVERAGE` environment variable. The pre-requisite is that your components are instrumented using [istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/).

### 1 - Instrument the code

Instrumenting the code is an important step, which allows lines of code to be tracked by Storybook. This is normally achieved by using instrumentation libraries such as the [Istanbul Babel plugin](https://github.com/istanbuljs/babel-plugin-istanbul), or its Vite counterpart. In Storybook, you can set up instrumentation in two different ways:

#### Using @storybook/addon-coverage

For select frameworks (React, Preact, HTML, Web components, Svelte and Vue) you can use the [@storybook/addon-coverage](https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-coverage) addon, which will automatically configure the plugin for you.

Install `@storybook/addon-coverage`:

```sh
yarn add -D @storybook/addon-coverage
```

And register it in your `.storybook/main.js` file:

```js
// .storybook/main.js
module.exports = {
  // ...rest of your code here
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-coverage'],
};
```

The addon has default options that might suffice for your project, and it accepts an [options object for project-specific configuration](https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-coverage#configuring-the-addon).

#### Manually configuring istanbul

If your framework does not use Babel or Vite, such as Angular, you will have to manually configure whatever flavor of [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) (Webpack loader, etc.) your project might require. Also, if your project uses Vue or Svelte, you will need to add one extra configuration for nyc.

You can find recipes in [this repository](https://github.com/yannbf/storybook-coverage-recipes) that include many different configurations and steps on how to set up coverage in each of them.

### 2 - Run tests with --coverage flag

After setting up instrumentation, run Storybook then run the test-runner with `--coverage`:

```sh
yarn test-storybook --coverage
```

The test runner will report the results in the CLI and generate a `coverage/storybook/coverage-storybook.json` file which can be used by `nyc`.

![](.github/assets/coverage-result.png)

> **Note**
> If your components are not shown in the report and you're using Vue or Svelte, it's probably because you're missing a .nycrc.json file to specify the file extensions. Use the [recipes](https://github.com/yannbf/storybook-coverage-recipes) for reference on how to set that up.

If you want to generate coverage reports with [different reporters](https://istanbul.js.org/docs/advanced/alternative-reporters/), you can use `nyc` and point it to the folder which contains the Storybook coverage file. `nyc` is a dependency of the test runner so you will already have it in your project.

Here's an example generating an `lcov` report:

```
npx nyc report --reporter=lcov -t coverage/storybook --report-dir coverage/storybook
```

This will generate a more detailed, interactive coverage summary that you can access at `coverage/storybook/index.html` file which can be explored and will show the coverage in detail:

![](.github/assets/coverage-report-html.png)

The `nyc` command will respect [nyc configuration files](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc#common-configuration-options) if you have them in your project.

If you want certain parts of your code to be deliberately ignored, you can use istanbul [parsing hints](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc#parsing-hints-ignoring-lines).

### 3 - Merging code coverage with coverage from other tools

The test runner reports coverage related to the `coverage/storybook/coverage-storybook.json` file. This is by design, showing you the coverage which is tested while running Storybook.

Now, you might have other tests (e.g. unit tests) which are _not_ covered in Storybook but are covered when running tests with Jest, which you might also generate coverage files from, for instance. In such cases, if you are using tools like [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) to automate reporting, the coverage files will be detected automatically and if there are multiple files in the coverage folder, they will be merged automatically.

Alternatively, in case you want to merge coverages from other tools, you should:

1 - move or copy the `coverage/storybook/coverage-storybook.json` into `coverage/coverage-storybook.json`;
2 - run `nyc report` against the `coverage` folder.

Here's an example on how to achieve that:

## Experimental test hook API

The test runner renders a story and executes its [play function](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function) if one exists. However, there are certain behaviors that are not possible to achieve via the play function, which executes in the browser. For example, if you want the test runner to take visual snapshots for you, this is something that is possible via Playwright/Jest, but must be executed in Node.

To enable use cases like visual or DOM snapshots, the test runner exports test hooks that can be overridden globally. These hooks give you access to the test lifecycle before and after the story is rendered.

There are three hooks: `setup`, `preRender`, and `postRender`. `setup` executes once before all the tests run. `preRender` and `postRender` execute within a test before and after a story is rendered.

The render functions are async functions that receive a [Playwright Page](https://playwright.dev/docs/pages) and a context object with the current story's `id`, `title`, and `name`. They are globally settable by `@storybook/test-runner`'s `setPreRender` and `setPostRender` APIs.

All three functions can be set up in the configuration file `.storybook/test-runner.js` which can optionally export any of these functions.

Apart from these hooks, there are additional properties you can set in `.storybook/test-runner.js`:

#### prepare

The test-runner has a default `prepare` function which gets the browser in the right environment before testing the stories. You can override this behavior, in case you might want to hack the behavior of the browser. For example, you might want to set a cookie, or add query parameters to the visiting URL, or do some authentication before reaching the Storybook URL. You can do that by overriding the `prepare` function.

The `prepare` function receives an object containing:

- `browserContext`: a [Playwright Browser Context](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext) instance
- `page`: a [Playwright Page](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page) instance.
- `testRunnerConfig`: the test runner configuration object, coming from the `.storybook/test-runner.js`.

For reference, please use the [default `prepare`](https://github.com/storybookjs/test-runner/blob/next/src/setup-page.ts#L12) function as a starting point.

> **Note**
> If you override the default prepare behavior, even though this is powerful, you will be responsible for properly preparing the browser. Future changes to the default prepare function will not get included in your project, so you will have to keep an eye out for changes in upcoming releases.

#### getHttpHeaders

The test-runner makes a few `fetch` calls to check the status of a Storybook instance, and to get the index of the Storybook's stories. Additionally, it visits a page using Playwright. In all of these scenarios, it's possible, depending on where your Storybook is hosted, that you might need to set some HTTP headers. For example, if your Storybook is hosted behind a basic authentication, you might need to set the `Authorization` header. You can do so by passing a `getHttpHeaders` function to your test-runner config. That function receives the `url` of the fetch calls and page visits, and should return an object with the headers to be set.

```js
// .storybook/test-runner.js
module.exports = {
  getHttpHeaders: async (url) => {
    const token = url.includes('prod') ? 'XYZ' : 'ABC';
    return {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    };
  },
};
```

> **Note**
> These test hooks are experimental and may be subject to breaking changes. We encourage you to test as much as possible within the story's play function.

### DOM snapshot recipe

The `postRender` function provides a [Playwright page](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page) instance, of which you can use for DOM snapshot testing:

```js
// .storybook/test-runner.js
module.exports = {
  async postRender(page, context) {
    // the #root element wraps the story. From Storybook 7.0 onwards, the selector should be #storybook-root
    const elementHandler = await page.$('#root');
    const innerHTML = await elementHandler.innerHTML();
    expect(innerHTML).toMatchSnapshot();
  },
};
```

When running with `--stories-json`, tests get generated in a temporary folder and snapshots get stored alongside. You will need to `--eject` and configure a custom [`snapshotResolver`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#snapshotresolver-string) to store them elsewhere, e.g. in your working directory:

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  resolveSnapshotPath: (testPath, snapshotExtension) =>
    path.join(process.cwd(), '__snapshots__', path.basename(testPath) + snapshotExtension),
  resolveTestPath: (snapshotFilePath, snapshotExtension) =>
    path.join(process.env.TEST_ROOT, path.basename(snapshotFilePath, snapshotExtension)),
  testPathForConsistencyCheck: path.join(process.env.TEST_ROOT, 'example.test.js'),
};
```

### Image snapshot recipe

Here's a slightly different recipe for image snapshot testing:

```js
// .storybook/test-runner.js
const { toMatchImageSnapshot } = require('jest-image-snapshot');

const customSnapshotsDir = `${process.cwd()}/__snapshots__`;

module.exports = {
  setup() {
    expect.extend({ toMatchImageSnapshot });
  },
  async postRender(page, context) {
    // If you want to take screenshot of multiple browsers, use
    // page.context().browser().browserType().name() to get the browser name to prefix the file name
    const image = await page.screenshot();
    expect(image).toMatchImageSnapshot({
      customSnapshotsDir,
      customSnapshotIdentifier: context.id,
    });
  },
};
```

There is also an exported `TestRunnerConfig` type available for TypeScript users.

### Render lifecycle

To visualize the test lifecycle, consider a simplified version of the test code automatically generated for each story in your Storybook:

```js
it('button--basic', async () => {
  // filled in with data for the current story
  const context = { id: 'button--basic', title: 'Button', name: 'Basic' };

  // playwright page https://playwright.dev/docs/pages
  await page.goto(STORYBOOK_URL);

  // pre-render hook
  if (preRender) await preRender(page, context);

  // render the story and run its play function (if applicable)
  await page.execute('render', context);

  // post-render hook
  if (postRender) await postRender(page, context);
});
```

### Utility functions

For more specific use cases, the test runner provides utility functions that could be useful to you.

#### getStoryContext

While running tests using the hooks, you might want to get information from a story, such as the parameters passed to it, or its args. The test runner now provides a `getStoryContext` utility function that fetches the story context for the current story:

```js
await getStoryContext(page, context);
```

You can use it for multiple use cases, and here's an example that combines the story context and accessibility testing:

```js
// .storybook/test-runner.js
const { getStoryContext } = require('@storybook/test-runner');
const { injectAxe, checkA11y, configureAxe } = require('axe-playwright');

module.exports = {
  async preRender(page, context) {
    await injectAxe(page);
  },
  async postRender(page, context) {
    // Get entire context of a story, including parameters, args, argTypes, etc.
    const storyContext = await getStoryContext(page, context);

    // Do not test a11y for stories that disable a11y
    if (storyContext.parameters?.a11y?.disable) {
      return;
    }

    // Apply story-level a11y rules
    await configureAxe(page, {
      rules: storyContext.parameters?.a11y?.config?.rules,
    });

    // from Storybook 7.0 onwards, the selector should be #storybook-root
    await checkA11y(page, '#root', {
      detailedReport: true,
      detailedReportOptions: {
        html: true,
      },
      // pass axe options defined in @storybook/addon-a11y
      axeOptions: storyContext.parameters?.a11y?.options,
    });
  },
};
```

#### StorybookTestRunner user agent

The test-runner adds a `StorybookTestRunner` entry to the browser's user agent. You can use it to determine if a story is rendering in the context of the test runner. This might be useful if you want to disable certain features in your stories when running in the test runner, though it's likely an edge case.

```js
export const MyStory = () => {
  const isTestRunner = window.navigator.userAgent.match(/StorybookTestRunner/);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Is this story running in the test runner?</p>
      <p>{isTestRunner ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Given that this check is happening in the browser, it is only applicable in the following scenarios:

- inside of a render/template function of a story
- inside of a play function
- inside of preview.js
- inside any other code that is executed in the browser

## Troubleshooting

#### The error output in the CLI is too short

By default, the test runner truncates error outputs at 1000 characters, and you can check the full output directly in Storybook, in the browser. If you do want to change that limit, however, you can do so by setting the `DEBUG_PRINT_LIMIT` environment variable to a number of your choosing, for example, `DEBUG_PRINT_LIMIT=5000 yarn test-storybook`.

#### The test runner seems flaky and keeps timing out

If your tests are timing out with `Timeout - Async callback was not invoked within the 15000 ms timeout specified by jest.setTimeout`, it might be that playwright couldn't handle to test the amount of stories you have in your project. Maybe you have a large amount of stories or your CI has a really low RAM configuration.

In either way, to fix it you should limit the amount of workers that run in parallel by passing the [--maxWorkers](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli#--maxworkersnumstring) option to your command:

```json
{
  "test-storybook:ci": "concurrently -k -s first -n \"SB,TEST\" -c \"magenta,blue\" \"yarn build-storybook --quiet && npx http-server storybook-static --port 6006 --silent\" \"wait-on tcp:6006 && yarn test-storybook --maxWorkers=2\""
}
```

#### The test runner reports "No tests found" running on a Windows CI

There is currently a [bug](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/8536) in Jest which means tests cannot be on a separate drive than the project. To work around this you will need to set the `TEMP` environment variable to a temporary folder on the same drive as your project. Here's what that would look like on GitHub Actions:

```yml
env:
  # Workaround for https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/8536
  TEMP: ${{ runner.temp }}
```

#### Adding the test runner to other CI environments

As the test runner is based on playwright, depending on your CI setup you might need to use specific docker images or other configuration. In that case, you can refer to the [Playwright CI docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci) for more information.

#### Merging test coverage results in wrong coverage

After merging test coverage reports coming from the test runner with reports from other tools (e.g. Jest), if the end result is **not** what you expected. Here's why:

The test runner uses `babel` as coverage provider, which behaves in a certain way when evaluating code coverage. If your other reports happen to use a different coverage provider than `babel`, such as `v8`, they will evaluate the coverage differently. Once merged, the results will likely be wrong.

Example: in `v8`, import and export lines are counted as coverable pieces of code, however in `babel`, they are not. This impacts the percentage of coverage calculation.

While the test runner does not provide `v8` as an option for coverage provider, it is recommended that you set your application's Jest config to use `coverageProvider: 'babel'` if you can, so that the reports line up as expected and get merged correctly.

For more context, [here's some explanation](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/11188#issue-830796941) why `v8` is not a 1:1 replacement for Babel/Istanbul coverage.
